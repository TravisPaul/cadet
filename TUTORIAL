=== INTRODUCTION ===

Cadet is a minimal interface between Lua and bozohttpd. With Cadet, it
should be possible to comfortably develop a web application and actually
deploy it from a base NetBSD installation.

Cadet is sort of like WSGI for Python or Rack for Ruby. It is not a
full-featured framework for rapid web application development (try Django or
Rails or somethign else instead). In order to use Cadet effectively, you
should know (or be willing to learn) thing or two about HTTP/1.1.

=== HELLO, CADET ===

    -- hello.lua
    Hello = {}

    function Hello.index(env, x, x)
      Cadet.response.body = "<h1>Lift off!</h1>"
      Cadet.finish()
    end

    httpd.register("hello", Hello.index)

    # /etc/inetd.conf

=== STATIC FILES ===

bozohttpd is already very good at serving static files. Cadet doesn't handle
that -- instead you "configure" bozohttp to handle static files from a
particular directory. 

So if your application has a structure like this:

    app/
      blog.lua

    public/
      css/
        style.css
      js/
        jquery.css

Then you invoke bozohttpd like this:

    http a b c d e f g /path/to/blog/public
