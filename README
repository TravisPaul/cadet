== CADET ==

Cadet is a minimal interface between bozohttpd and Lua. It's kind of like
WSGI for Python, or Rack for Ruby, except Cadet is designed *only* for
bozohttpd.


=== CADET'S GOALS ===

With Cadet, you should be able to comfortably develop dynamic web
applications and actually deploy them from a base NetBSD installation.
LuaRocks nor even pkgsrc are required.


=== REQUIREMENTS ===

You need a fairly recent version of bozohttpd -- one with Lua support,
naturally. The bozohttpd which ships with NetBSD 6 is not new enough.


=== LICENSE ===

Cadet is released under a 2-clause BSD-style license. See the LICENSE file
for details.
